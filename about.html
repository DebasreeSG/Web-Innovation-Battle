          <p>Hi there!I'm a passionate learner with a keen interest in technology and its ability to shape our future. Currently, I’m pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science at the University of Engineering & Management, Kolkata, with a focus on Cybersecurity, Blockchain Technology, and Internet of Things. While my studies are centered around computer science, my love for biology has profoundly influenced my academic and career aspirations. I believe that technology has the power to revolutionize the field of biology, and I am dedicated to combining my knowledge of computer science with biological sciences. My goal is to develop innovative solutions that can address pressing challenges in healthcare, environmental conservation, and biological research. Throughout my educational journey, I've always enjoyed exploring the wonders of science and technology. I strive to blend my academic knowledge with hands-on experience, which I believe is essential for personal and professional growth. In my spare time, I actively engage in various extracurricular activities, from participating in various cultural and technical events to being an enthusiastic member of my college's clubs. These experiences not only allow me to develop my social communication and leadership skills but also provide opportunities for collaboration and teamwork. I am particularly keen on developing my skills in programming languages like Python and Java, which I see as invaluable tools for analyzing biological data and creating simulations. I also enjoy working with software tools such as AutoCAD, which can be instrumental in various biological applications, including bioinformatics and data visualization. I am excited to continue learning and growing in this dynamic field, and I hope to make a positive impact through my work.Furthermore, I am always open to learning new things and expanding my horizons. I love to participate in the events my college conducts, including hackathons and tech fairs. Attending seminars and workshops not only broadens my knowledge but also helps me connect with professionals and experts in my field. These interactions have been invaluable in my journey, as they allow me to learn about the latest advancements and trends in science and technology.Thank you for taking the time to read about me! If you'd like to connect or learn more, feel free to reach out. I look forward to exploring the exciting possibilities that lie ahead in the field of research, developement and technology!</p>
